HW1 


HW1.1  

(1) function1.py  is for function simulation, you can choose to simulate sin(x) or sin(x)/x by commentting out the corresponding parts in the code
       
(2) mnist1.py is for actural tasks. There are three models. You can choose from MNIST or CIFAR-10 datasets by commentting the corresponding parts in code. If you choose MNIST, change the first layer channel number from 3 to 1 and change the network size. By default, it use CIFAR-10. 

HW1.2

(1) function2.py  and mnist2.py are for question 1.2 (1) and (2)

(1) Visualize the optimization process.
(2) Observe gradient norm during training.
It will display the PCA results by default when it finish. It will display the gradient norm when you close the first figure.

(3)mini_ratio.py is for 1.2 (3)



HW1.3

(1) random label

rand_label.py 


(2) Number of parameters

number_parameter.py

(3) Flatness v.s. Generalization

part 1

mnist_interpolation.py

part 2
